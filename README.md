This work has been possible thanks of all the community members that expose blockchain APIs to the public ❤️

All these contributors are displayed on the load balancer home page.

<br>

## Main features of this load balancer:
- Node health monitoring
- Re-routing requests on failures
- Intelligent request caching mechanism
- Deployed on a distributed infrastructure
- Webpage with stats and contributors for each service
- Multiple chains and service available
- Built from scratch

<br>

Feel free to include, edit or remove your RPCs, LCDs, and other APIs in the proper configuration files by submitting a pull request. The load balancer will update its configuration when these files are modified.

Any contribution is highly appreciated.

<br>

## Usage
Use the available endpoints as if they were normal APIs. The load balancer will take care of the rest.
